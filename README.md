🌍 Air Quality Monitoring Analysis – Data Science Toolbox Project
📌 Project Overview
This project is part of the Data Science Toolbox: Python Programming module, focused on analyzing real-world air quality data across India. The objective is to perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization using Python tools such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

🎯 Goals of the Project
The main goal is to understand the patterns in air quality monitoring and pollutant distribution by answering key analytical questions (objectives) based on the dataset provided.

🗃️ Dataset Overview
The dataset contains air quality data collected from various monitoring stations in India, with the following key columns:

country

state

city

station

last_update

latitude, longitude

pollutant_id

pollutant_min, pollutant_max, pollutant_avg

🛠️ Steps Followed
Data Loading & Initial Inspection

Data Cleaning – handling missing values, duplicates

Outlier Detection – using IQR method

Correlation Analysis – exploring relationships between features

Objective-based Visualizations
